# Master-Thesis-Tuebingen
Here, I present all the experimental data that I obtained and the simulations conducted based on experimental IVC, along with several plots, for my master's thesis at TÃ¼bingen University from 2022 to 2023. The new data for the external noise measurment is updated. Some of the scripts were written with the assistance of ChatGPT.
